# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this product is

ForgeHub is a control plane for planning, governing, and executing software projects with AI agents: product/version/project registration, pipeline stages with mandatory artifacts and approval gates, planning items (features/bugs/etc.) broken into tasks, task executions by agents, and an audit trail tying every entity back to a product version. It replaces the previous "Hermes Agent Forge" naming throughout the codebase, UI, and docs.

Full domain model and business rules: `docs/PRD.md` (vision, journeys, definition of done) and `docs/SPEC.md` (entities, business rules, acceptance criteria — see especially §6 for the per-domain rule list referenced from model/route docstrings).

Core invariant from the PRD: no feature, bug, task, skill, execution, or artifact may exist without linkage to product, version, project, planning, pipeline, owner, status, audit trail, and validation criteria. Most tables exist to keep that traceability chain unbroken, not just to store data.

## Canonical stack (confirmed, supersedes SPEC.md §2/§3.2)

`docs/SPEC.md` describes a C#/ASP.NET Core + Dapper backend. That is **stale** — the implemented backend stack matches `docs/TECHNOLOGY.md`:

- Backend: Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (async) + asyncpg, Alembic migrations, OAuth2 password flow + JWT, pytest + httpx for tests.
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite, TypeScript, shadcn/ui (Tailwind + Radix primitives, via `class-variance-authority`/`clsx`/`tailwind-merge`) + Framer Motion, TanStack Query + Zustand, React Hook Form + Zod, Vitest + React Testing Library.
- Datastore: PostgreSQL (pgvector/pg16), shared instance `company_postgres` on port 5433, database `forgehub`, schema `company` (**every** table — models set `MetaData(schema=settings.POSTGRES_SCHEMA)` in `backend/app/db/base.py`, never `public`). ForgeHub does not run its own Postgres container; `database/postgres-company/docker-compose.yml` only re-documents/recreates the externally-managed container definition (see its trailing comment — do not blindly `docker compose up` there without checking config drift, Kanboard depends on the same container). Full topology: `docs/DB_README.md` and `/root/.hermes/foundation/governance/POSTGRESQL_TOPOLOGY.md`. The other instance, `foundation_postgres` (port 5432), is reserved for internal Hermes/Foundation data — never put ForgeHub application data there.
- Integrations already provisioned in `.env`: Postgres connection (`company_postgres:5433/forgehub`), Kanboard (URL/user/token).

When implementing, follow `docs/TECHNOLOGY.md` over `docs/SPEC.md` wherever they conflict (backend language/framework, directory layout). `docs/SPEC.md` remains the source of truth for the domain model, business rules, and acceptance criteria — only its tech-stack sections (§2, §3.2) and its directory layout (§10) are superseded.

## Commands

All commands assume `.env` at the repo root (Postgres + Kanboard credentials) is present.

**Run the full stack (Docker):**
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
curl http://localhost:8000/health        # → {"status":"ok"}
open http://localhost:4173               # frontend (served via `serve`, built dist)
```

**Backend, local dev:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Backend migrations (Alembic, async, schema `company`):**
```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<message>"   # picks up new models via app/db/models/__init__.py
```

**Backend tests (pytest + httpx, hits the real `company_postgres` DB — no mocking):**
```bash
cd backend
pytest                                  # all tests
pytest app/tests/test_product.py        # single domain
pytest app/tests/test_product.py::test_create_get_list_product   # single test
```
Tests use `httpx.AsyncClient` with `ASGITransport` against the real FastAPI `app` and the real async session from `app/db/base.py`. There is no test-DB isolation/transaction rollback — each test creates its own rows (usually with a UUID-suffixed unique name) and explicitly deletes them in a `finally`/cleanup helper. Tests require migrations to have been applied first (tables must exist).

**Frontend, local dev:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # vite dev server, port 5173, proxies to VITE_API_URL (default http://localhost:8000)
npm run build         # tsc -b && vite build
npm run preview       # serves the production build, port 4173 (matches docker-compose)
npm test               # vitest, jsdom environment, setup file at src/test/setup.ts
```

## Architecture

### Backend: domain-module pattern

The backend is organized as independent **domain modules**, each touching exactly three layers under `backend/app/`:

```
db/models/<domain>.py     SQLAlchemy ORM models for that domain's tables
api/schemas/<domain>.py   Pydantic request/response schemas
api/routes/<domain>.py    APIRouter with the domain's full CRUD surface
```

Domains: `product`, `project`, `pipeline`, `backlog`, `task`, `agent`, `artifact`, `governance`, plus `foundation` (special — see below) and `auth` (placeholder — see below).

Key conventions, binding for any new domain code (stated in docstrings across `db/base.py` and the model files — read one model file like `db/models/product.py` before adding to a domain):

- **UUID primary keys, Python-side default.** Always `mapped_column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)`. Never autoincrement ints or server-side `gen_random_uuid()` — IDs must exist before flush/commit.
- **`TimestampMixin`** (in `db/base.py`) gives every model `created_at`/`updated_at` for free — don't redeclare them.
- **Cross-domain foreign keys are string-form and lazy.** A domain never imports another domain's model module to declare an FK; it writes `ForeignKey("company.<table>.id")` as a plain string. This avoids import-order coupling between domain modules. All domain modules get imported together (and thus all FKs resolved) centrally in `app/db/models/__init__.py`, which Alembic's `env.py` also imports for autogenerate.
- **Polymorphic references use (entity_type, entity_id), not a FK** — e.g. `governance.Approval`/`AuditEvent` target many different table types and deliberately skip a real FK (see `db/models/governance.py` docstring).
- **Status/enum-like fields are plain `String` + a `CheckConstraint`**, not native Postgres ENUM types — keeps migrations simple, avoids `ALTER TYPE` churn. The allowed value tuple lives next to the model (e.g. `PRODUCT_VERSION_STATUSES` in `db/models/product.py`) and is re-validated at the route layer.
- **Business rules live at the API layer, not as DB constraints**, whenever they require a second statement or cross-row checks (e.g. "every product must have ≥1 version" — enforced in `create_product`/`delete_version` in `api/routes/product.py`, not a constraint). Route docstrings cite the specific SPEC.md §6 rule they implement — check there before changing CRUD behavior.
- **Routes own their full path.** Every `api/routes/<domain>.py` exports a module-level `router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1/<resource>", tags=[...])`; `app/main.py` only does `app.include_router(...)` and never adds prefixes itself.
- **Settings are centralized.** `app/core/config.py`'s `settings` object (pydantic-settings, loads repo-root `.env`) is the only place reading env vars — `db/base.py`, `core/security.py`, and `alembic/env.py` all import `settings` rather than touching `os.environ` directly.

### Backend: non-domain pieces

- **`auth.py` is an explicit placeholder.** It checks credentials against a single hardcoded dev user from `settings.DEV_USER_USERNAME`/`DEV_USER_PASSWORD` — there is no real Users/Auth domain yet (out of scope per PRD/SPEC at this stage). Its docstring asks that a future real implementation keep the same contract (`POST /api/v1/auth/token`, `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` in, `{access_token, token_type}` out).
- **`foundation.py` is a different kind of router** — it doesn't touch the database at all. It reads from filesystem mounts (`/vault/Agents`, `/profiles`) to expose Hermes Foundation agent metadata (SOUL.md, sub-agents, skills, MEMORY.md) over HTTP. Those mounts come from `docker-compose.yml`'s bind mounts of `/root/.hermes/foundation/vault` and `/root/.hermes/profiles` — this router will 404/return empty data if run outside that container or without equivalent local mounts.
- **`docker-compose.yml`** also joins the external `hermes_foundation_pg_default` network (for reaching `company_postgres`) in addition to backend↔frontend's own default network.

### Frontend: per-domain page + hook pairing

Each backend domain has a matching `frontend/src/pages/<domain>/` (typically `index.tsx` list view, `[id].tsx` detail view, `<Domain>Form.tsx`) and a `frontend/src/hooks/use<Domain>.ts` (TanStack Query hooks). `src/lib/api.ts` is the single fetch wrapper everything goes through — domain hooks call `apiClient.get/post/put/patch/delete` with the exact `/api/v1/<resource>` path; never hardcode `BASE_URL` or add path segments elsewhere. `BASE_URL` comes from `VITE_API_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`).

`src/components/ui/` holds shadcn/ui primitives (button, card, input, select, table, etc.) — extend this set via the shadcn CLI/pattern rather than hand-rolling alternatives.

## UI library governance

Canonical UI stack is shadcn/ui + Radix + Tailwind (+ Framer Motion when justified). Any other UI library is "complementary": adopting one requires checking license, accessibility, bundle impact, maintenance, and security, and an ADR is required if it replaces the canonical stack, introduces a parallel design system, or is premium/commercial in production. Full policy: `docs/SPEC.md` §7.
